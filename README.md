# Pong for iOS

This was a group final project for C323 at Indiana University created by myself, Jake Oliger, as well as my partner Dilzat. Dilzat did the storyboard for the settings page of the app. I contributed almost all of the code. I created the initial files and structure of the program, the GameViewController, the GameScene and all of the game logic, the HighscoresTableViewController and the HighScoresModel, and the SettingsModel. I did all of the implementation for Core Data and SpriteKit. All of the logic for the persistence of settings and the usage of settings within the game was done by me.

The project was originally hosted on a class repository on IU GitHub [here](https://github.iu.edu/C323-Summer2021/Team-10/tree/master/finalproject). Because the repository is controlled by the professor and AIs, for the sake of posterity I've re-hosted the project files here.
